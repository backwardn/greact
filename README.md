# MadTitan

Inter galactic test runner and test framework for  Go frontend projects.

The name madtitan originate from nickname of Thanos (comics character), he
is obsessed with collecting infinity stones, this project is obsessed with
collecting all the good parts of javascript testing eco system with the go ones
to bring smooth developer experience for frontend works using the Go
programming language.

 __ warning__ I have actively tested this on darwin (os x), if you have issue
with a different os open it here and probably someone else who uses your os
might help.

## Features

- [x] Fast 
- [x] Combines good parts from the go testing package, karma,jest,jasmine etc
- [x] Write unit tests.
- [x] Write integration tests (vecty only), yep now you can test your vecty components.

 - [x] Like thanos who aims to destroy half of the universe, we will destroy half
 of your frontend project's problems by ensuring it meets your expectations.

Note that theoretically all browser's supporting the chrome debug protocol must
work. Unfortunate I'm only interested in chrome so if you want to take a stab
at testing with another browser you are welcome.

- [x] chrome
- [ ] firefox (not tested)
